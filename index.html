          <p>
          The SunCondor is the most advance all-weather, long endurance (quasi-permanent:  Designed for 5 years+ continuous duty @ 62,000feet) Unmanned Solar/Fuel-Cell-Powered surveillance payload platform, capable of:
            <ol>
              <li>Flying to almost anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world, </li>
              <li>Host almost any desired Payload:  SunCondor can be scaled up/down as needed</li>
              <li>Loiter indefinitely over designated area</li>
              <li>Track a particular target of interest from almost anywhere to almost anywhere</li>
              <li>Designed to be Mesh-network compatible, each SunCondor acting as Server, capable of daisy-chained data communications relay for Hyper-Broadband Internet communications: Can be used as a low-cost, high capacity atmospheric Internet Communications Network Server instead of satellites.</li>

          BIO
        </h3>
        <p>
        Jerome Pearson is President of STAR, Inc., a small business in Mount Pleasant, SC he founded in 1998 that has developed aircraft and spacecraft technology under contracts to Air Force, NASA, DARPA, and NIAC. He started as an aerospace engineer for NASA Langley and Ames during the Apollo Program, and received the NASA Apollo Achievement Award in 1969. He joined the Air Force Research Laboratory in 1971, and developed vibration control for high-power lasers and a kinetic-kill vehicle concept for SDI in the 1980’s. As Chief of the AFRL Structural Dynamics Branch, he helped develop the high-temperature acoustics test facility at Wright-Patterson AFB in Ohio, which was used for AMRAAM testing and NASP development. </p>
<p>
Mr. Pearson conceived many original ideas for space technology, including a propellantless maneuvering space vehicle, a Moon and Mars gravity simulator for LEO, a zero-g massmeter, and a rocket or gun plus a rotating space tether for Earth-to-space launches. He invented the space elevator, and his publication in Acta Astronautica in 1975 introduced the concept to the world spaceflight community. Arthur Clarke then contacted him for the technical background of his novel, “The Fountains of Paradise,” published in 1978. Clarke duly credited Pearson in the Afterward, but many people even today credit Clarke with the idea of the space elevator. In the 1980’s he consulted for Walt Disney World in Florida, and helped design the Communicore Pavilion. </p>
<p>
Mr. Pearson has degrees in engineering and geology, and is the author of nearly 100 technical articles, including invited articles for Encyclopaedia Britannica and New Scientist. He proposed a global warming solution, an explanation for the failure of SETI, and space elevators for Earth and Moon, all published in international journals. He has been interviewed on radio and TV and in You Tube videos about space elevators, lunar development, and global warming, and was featured in a Discovery Channel series on “Science of the Impossible.” He is a Fellow of the British Interplanetary Society, an Associate Fellow of the AIAA, and member of the AIAA Space Colonization Technical Committee. In 2002 was elected Member of the International Academy of Astronautics, sponsored by Sir Arthur Clarke, and is active in the IAA Commission 3 with proposals for removal of space debris.
